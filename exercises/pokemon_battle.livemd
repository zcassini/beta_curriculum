## Overview

You're going to create a pokemon battle game. If you're not familiar with pokemon, it's a game where elemental creatures battle.

You're going to represent pokemon using a `Pokemon` struct with the keys `:name`, `:type`, `:health`, `:attack`, and `:speed`. Enforce that all keys must have a value.

* `:name` is a string.
* `:type` will be an atom of either `:grass`, `:water`, or `:fire`
* `:health` will be an integer with a default value of `20`
* `:attack` will be an integer with a default value of `5`
* `:speed` will be an integer

<div style="padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">
You do not need to validate the data types for the keys above.
These are simply the expected data types for each `Pokemon` struct instance.
</div>

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
%Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur", type: :grass, health: 20, attack: 5, speed: 20}
```

Then implement the `Pokemon.attack/2` function according to the documented examples.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
attacker = %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur", type: :grass, health: 20, attack: 5, speed: 20}
defender = %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur", type: :grass, health: 20, attack: 5, speed: 20}

Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
# output: subtract attack from health to return an updated pokemon struct
%Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur", type: :grass, health: 15, attack: 5, speed: 20}
```

`Pokemon.attack/2` should apply double damage if the pokemon has a type advantage, and half damage if the pokemon has a type disadvantage.

The advantages are:

* `:fire` is strong against `:grass`
* `:grass` is strong against `:water`
* `:water` is strong against `:fire`
* `:fire` is weak against `:water`
* `:grass` is weak against `:fire`
* `:water` is weak against `:grass`
* the same type should deal normal damage.

```elixir
attacker = %Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire, health: 20, attack: 5, speed: 20}
defender = %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur", type: :grass, health: 20, attack: 5, speed: 20}

Pokemon.attack(attacker, defender)
# output: subtract attack (doubled) from health to return an updated pokemon struct
%Pokemon{name: "Bulbasaur", type: :grass, health: 10, attack: 5, speed: 20}
```

```elixir

  return an updated pokemon struct, and take type advantage into consideration.

  ## Examples

    Same Type

  def attack(attacker, defender) do
    attack_damage = attacker.attack * attack_multiplier(attacker, defender)
    %Pokemon{defender | health: defender.health - attack_damage}
  end

  def attack_multiplier(attacker, defender) do
    case {attacker.type, defender.type} do
      {:fire, :grass} -> 2
      {:grass, :water} -> 2
      {:water, :fire} -> 2
      {:fire, :water} -> 0.5
      {:grass, :fire} -> 0.5
      {:water, :grass} -> 0.5
      _ -> 1
    end
  end
end
```

### Pokemon Instances

Bind three variables `charmander`, `bulbasaur`, and `squirtle` to an instance of a `Pokemon` struct with the following information.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class charmander {
    name: "Charmander"
    type: :fire
    health: 20
    attack: 5
    speed: 20
  }
  class bulbasaur {
    name: "Bulbasar"
    type: :grass
    health: 20
    attack: 5
    speed: 20
  }
  class squirtle {
    name: "Squirtle"
    type: :water
    health: 20
    attack: 5
    speed: 20
  }
```

Use may these three structs to test your `Pokemon.attack/2` function.

<summary>Example solution</summary>

```elixir
charmander = %Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire, health: 20, attack: 5, speed: 20}

squirtle = %Pokemon{name: "Squirtle", type: :water, health: 20, attack: 5, speed: 20}

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
charmander = %Pokemon{name: "Charmander", type: :fire}
bulbasaur = %Pokemon{name: "Bulbasar", type: :grass}
squirtle = %Pokemon{name: "Squirtle", type: :water}
